What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
	This allows you to do too big or too small commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	Because Git was made thinking in codes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	By typing 'git log' to see the log of modifications, then using 'git diff' to compare the diference among then.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	While using version control you don't need to worry so much about making mistakes, once you can, with relative ease, reverse your code to a older version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	Keeping version-control of my projects and fix bugs.
