When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	Is a good thing to use a remote repository mainly when we are working with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with
your remote repository?
	Because it would pull changes even made by other people. In the way it works today I can choose
	what commits I want to up-to-date.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork is like a clone, but for the GitHub itself. The repository instead of be copied to our machine
	continues on the site's server. When we branch a ramification on the commits. The fork is a better
	option rather than clone in the case that you want to make your own version of some project. Or if
	you want to make changes in the code and don't have permission to push commits there.
