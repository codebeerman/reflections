When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	Is a good thing to use a remote repository mainly when we are working with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with
your remote repository?
	Because it would pull changes even made by other people. In the way it works today I can choose
	what commits I want to up-to-date.
